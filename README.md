# FinalProjectDeltaPredictBackend
Final project which I developed along with my partner Iris Grabois, provides real-time information about the S&P 500. We have also included a forecast for the closing prices, allowing the user to make informed investment decisions. The forecast is a combination of a technical forecast using both Monte Carlo and ARIMA algorithms, as well as a sentiment analysis. The stocks are given scores Based on their mention in the news, using positive or negative words from a pre-existing dictionary. The website was built using React Native on the client-side and Flask Framework on the backend.
